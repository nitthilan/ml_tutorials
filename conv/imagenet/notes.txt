Task list Jana:
- Reading about various implementation details of ImageNet experiments?
       - checking out code base of open source implementations.
- How to reduce the file reads while doing ImageNet experiment?
- What parameters in a neural network would control the speed up of ImageNet experiments?
- Run the current architecture to check how long it takes to learn?
- MultiGPU run of ImageNet to parallelize learning? 

List of things to do:
- Do image resizer and store the resized images
- Pass the resized images and store the output from the network
- from keras.utils import multi_gpu_model
